### Requirements
We are looking for Software Engineers with a solid understanding of the foundation and inner-workings of Laravel / Symfony Frameworks, their components, and Database Management.

We want you to explore new avenues, experiment, and share your knowledge with your co-workers. We want you to ask questions, develop unique solutions, provide feedback for improvement.

That being said, you need to know about **message queue, task scheduling, building microservices, integrating APIs with various levels of complexities. Developing scalable services for data acquisition, processing, and analysis**. You must be system security conscious.

We don’t really care about your educational background. You need to be able to Speak and Write English in a proper way, that’s good enough for us.

### Responsibilities
Our main focus on Market Analysis and Automation. You will be assigned to a team or to build services alone. You will be provided with a clear guideline of what we need and a map of the inner-working of that task. You will have to come up with a plan that can materialize your assignment. You will have to do extensive testing alone or as a part of a team. You have to be able to provide a clear functional guideline about how everything comes together and works. Depending on the situation, you might have to plan, design, build a functional API for a service you or someone else built.

### The Hows
We use Google Chat via G Suite for communication, monitoring, and overall company operation. Your tasks will be assigned by your respective Project Manager via Google Chat, sometimes on Trello. We will provide you with a company Email for communication. You will be using git to manage your codes, share with the team, and deploy.

We are open to buying a license for any tool you may need, based on its viability for the company and open to all the Memes you can share ;) We also have a kick-ass Minecraft server :D

This is a **Remote job** and you have to work from your home. We don’t have a fixed working hour, as long as you are finishing the provided task, we are fine with it. That being said we do have Team meetings once or twice a week.
